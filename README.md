# Nigeria Infrastructure Risk Mapping

This project predicts road and bridge failure risks in Nigeria using "GIS and AI", linking infrastructure risk to "economic impact". The goal is to help policymakers and planners prioritize maintenance investments.

## Project Structure
- Data: Placeholder for datasets (bridge inventory, traffic, environmental data)
- Notebooks: Starter Python notebooks for ML + GIS modeling
- Visuals: Maps, charts, and figures for project outputs
- 1-Page_Outline.pdf: Executive summary ready for mentor outreach

## Methodology
1. GIS mapping of transport corridors
2. ML models to predict infrastructure failure
3. Economic impact scoring of high-risk areas
4. Interactive visualizations for decision support

## Outputs
- Ranked list of high-risk corridors
- Interactive GIS map highlighting failure zones
- Executive summary PDF
- Code repository for transparency and collaboration
